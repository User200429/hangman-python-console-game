## 🎮 Hangman – A Console-Based Word Guessing Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Hangman game using Python. The game randomly selects a word from a predefined list, and the player must guess the word one letter at a time. Each incorrect guess results in a part of the hangman being drawn. The game ends when the player either correctly guesses the word or runs out of lives.
